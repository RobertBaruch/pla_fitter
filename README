Very simple fitter for the ATF15xx series of CPLDs.

Usage: python3 pla_fitter.py <output-jed-file> <pla-files>...

The first PLA file should be a pin file, which specifies the names of pins of input and output signals.

Then the next PLA files should contain logic. An xor file consists only of 2-input XOR gates, and any other file consists only of AND-OR logic.

Registers are not supported. In fact, many things are not supported. Only combinatorial layers of AND-OR and XOR gates are supported.

See the top of pla_filter.py for information about the PLA file formats.

Prerequisites:

You must have bitarray, munkres, and pyeda installed via pip3, and also you must have checked out the prjbureau repo (https://github.com/whitequark/prjbureau) and added the repo to your PYTHONPATH.
